1 Master & 3 Nodes
Master – 4 CPU, 16GB , 100HDD, & 30GB HDD (docker-storage)
3 Nodes – 4 CPU, 16GB , 100HDD, & 30GB HDD (docker-storage)
Resolve DNS Look up
Add hostnames in /etc/hosts in all master & nodes
 
Passwordless Authentication Setup
 
Copy the .ssh/id_rsa.pub to all Master & Nodes under .ssh/authorized_keys
 
 
 
Now login to your master first, it should go without password. 
 
Do the same for all master & nodes, and login from Master, should go without password

Disconnected Installation: Version 3.7
I assume we already have RHN Server with all downloadable repositories and Openshift Enterprise container platform subscription activated. 
RHN Server: http://rhn.virtusalabs.com 
Create a repository in all Master & Nodes
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo














 
 
start with Installing Base Packages
Docker Setup
Install docker-1.12.6 version in all master & nodes
 
Check the attached 30GB HDD
 
Configure docker-storage-setup
Add the below entries in /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
DEVS=xvdb
VG=docker-vg

 

Then disable lvm cluster
lvmconf --disable-cluster
 

Run docker-storage-setup
 

Check the docker-storage-volume
 

Check the docker-storage configuration

 

Start and enable Docker on all OpenShift nodes.
$ systemctl enable docker && systemctl start docker

 



Installation of Openshift Container platform

yum -y install atomic-openshift-docker-excluder \
atomic-openshift-excluder atomic-openshift-utils \
bind-utils bridge-utils git \
iptables-services net-tools wget 

 
On the master and node1,node2 remove OpenShift exclusions from /etc/yum.conf.
atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
 
Install the OpenShift Container Platform using tools provided in the atomic-openshift-utils package. Installation will take 20-45 minutes depending on system resources.
 atomic-openshift-installer install
 
 
 
 
 

To add nodes/additional masters  (added 1 master & 3 Nodes )
 
Continue…
 
Press enter to continue
 
Leave blank to take its default master IP.
Give your subdomain
 
 
Press enter to continue
 
 
If you feel, everything is correct then continue
 
 
Installation started
 
 
 
 

For 3.7
	 

When the installation completes, re-add exclusions to /etc/yum.conf.
 
7.	Verify that all nodes and pods are in "Running"/"Ready" status.
[root@master ~]# oc get pods
 
 
Enable scheduling on master
 
Verify that atomic-openshift-master and atomic-openshift-node are running on master server and that atomic-openshift-node is running on the node server.
# systemctl status | grep openshift
On Master:
 
On Nodes
 
If not already installed, install the httpd-tools package.
yum -y install httpd-tools
Create the credential file under /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
touch /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
Once the file is created, add a user with the name user1 and the password user1 using the htpasswd utility.
# htpasswd -b /etc/origin/openshift-passwd user1 redhat
Once the install completes, edit the master-config file to enable authentication using HTPasswd with credentials stored in /etc/origin/openshift-passwd. Save and close the file.
On master node, under the oauthConfig section in file /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml, replace the value kind: DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider with kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider, being mindful of indentation.
oauthConfig:
    name: deny_all
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider 
Being mindful of indentation, create a new file attribute either directly above OR directly below the previously edited kind attribute, pointing to /etc/origin/openshift-passwd, which is the file that will contain OpenShift authentication info.
name: htpasswd_auth   
 provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      file: /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
Assure that the cluster recognizes the new user. On the master node, restart the atomic-openshift-master service:
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
 
Verify login either using the OC command-line client or by logging into the OpenShift web console as the newly-created user user1
Open a web browser window and navigate to https://eu-ose.virtusalabs.com:8443. Since the master host uses a self-signed certificate, you will need to manually add an acception for your hostname in your browser settings. 
Once the exception is added, you should be forwarded to the OpenShift Container Platform login page. Enter username user1 and password redhat.
Once logged in, you should be presented with a "Welcome to OpenShift" greeting.
 

 
Login to the master and create an admin user for external access through UI or CLI.
oc login -u system:admin -n default
 
Granth the cluster-admin role to user (admin)

[root@master1 ~]# oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
cluster-admin admin
 

 
GUI
To access GUI simply point browser from laptop at the master on port 8443 (https://eu-ose.virtusalabs.com:8443).
